I am a recent Integrated MSci Chemical Physics with Work Placement graduate with first-class honours, from the University of Glasgow, with a strong skillset in physics, programming, and chemistry. I have experience in international scientific research, having spent a year working at the Diamond Light Source synchrotron, carrying out advanced chemical analytical techniques, alongside scrutinous data analysis. Furthermore, I have experience in programming, through my masterâ€™s project I built and implemented agent-based models in Python to
study economic systems through physics concepts.

My academic pathway has been guided by a desire to develop a range of interdisciplinary skills which can be applicable and of use to a variety of challenges. My current career goals are in software development as a result of sustained interest and enjoyment in the programming aspects of my projects and work.  

Other hobbies of mine include: Photography, Ultimate Frisbee, Bikepacking, Art, Piano, Woodworking and Videography.

This list changes constantly as I'm experimenting with new experiences that I haven't tried yet. Who knows what's next for me!
