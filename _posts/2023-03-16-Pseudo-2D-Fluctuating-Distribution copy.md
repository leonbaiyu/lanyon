title: Pseudo-2D Kinetic Theory of Gases Model
---

A Pseudo-2D Kinetic Theory of Gases Model was developed as an adaptation of the 2D Gas Model, removing it's geometric dependence (positions of particles), whilst attempting to retain reality of the kinetic theory model. 

### <b>Velocity</b> distribution of a Pseudo 2D Model
The resulting velocity distribution from this model is depicted in the diagram below.

The animation clearly shows an instant relaxation from all individuals having identical velocity to forming the shape of the fitted Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution (fitted to an average of the final 10 distributions).

### <b>Energy</b> distribution of a Homogenous Saving Parameter simulation
Later, the model incorporated a saving parameter to emulate saving in economic systems. This essentially allows individuals to save a proportion of their energy/wealth from involvement in a transaction. The animation depicted below is of a simulation in which all agents have the same saving parameter (homogenous) of 0.5. The consequence of this parameter is that the exponential Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution in energy/money is shifted higher, becoming a peaked energy/money distribution with exponential decay on either side, resembling a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution in velocity. Evolution of this energy/money distribution is seen in the animation below.

The animation shows an instant relaxation from all individuals having equal energy/money to forming the Maxwell-Boltzmann-like distribution of the averaged final distribution for a simulation with homogenous saving parameter of 0.5. The proposed effect of this saving parameter is to limit the amount of energy/money risked by all parties in an interaction, reducing the average amount gained and lost, thus contracting the peak. This effect is more clear in the results of the thesis.
